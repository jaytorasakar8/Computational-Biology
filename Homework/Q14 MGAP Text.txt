Problem
For the computation of an alignment score generalizing the edit alignment score, let m denote the score assigned to matched symbols, d denote the score assigned to mismatched non-gap symbols, and g denote the score assigned a symbol matched to a gap symbol '-' (i.e., g is a linear gap penalty).

Given: Two DNA strings s and t in FASTA format (each of length at most 5000 bp).

Return: The maximum number of gap symbols that can appear in any maximum score alignment of s and t with score parameters satisfying m>0, d<0, and g<0.
